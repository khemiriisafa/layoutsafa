    <h2>Cofee</h2>
    <p>Coffee is a beverage made from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plant. It is a darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic beverage that has a stimulating effect on humans due to its caffeine content.</p>

  <div class="column middle">
    <h2>Coffe types</h2>
    <p>There are two main types of coffee plants. The Coffea arabica, the most common. Most of the world's coffee is made from Arabica beans,[1] and the Coffea robusta, which is easier to grow in places where Arabica will not grow.</p>
    <p>In the past, people gave names to new Arabica coffees from the port they came from. The two oldest Arabica coffees are "Mocha" and "Java". Today, names are more specific. They tell us the country, region, and sometimes even the property where they come from</p>
